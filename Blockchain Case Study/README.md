The company has its foundations based on Security, Transparency, Flexibility and Privacy. Leveraging the power of Blockchain Technologies to store the information in a trusted manner. Their clients come from a wide range of Industries, such as, Health Insurance, Life Insurance, Logistics, Education, and Charity, among them.

### Features of their services

- Sharable. ShareRing provides mechanisms to connects multiple services throughout one single repository.
- Privacy. Most importantly, the customer owns the information, no one else. All thanks to the traceability and security that blockchain technologies enable.

### Why This Matters

- All the sensitive information gets stored in a trusted location. No more need to create copies and copies of the same information. Reducing the risk of data leakages.

### Why This May be Interesting

Emerging blockchain tech are getting more more funding, since they are seen as solutions that are going to have the biggest impact in the next century. With the services that ShareRing offers another companies can operate in a shared marketplace, where customers can request product and services with less effort. Of course, the platform will involve a payment system, but here is where the blockchain technologies make this interesting, with the help of smart-contracts, companies can operate in a trusted environment. To have a clearer example, imagine a customer renting a car; many documents involved from different parties, all of them linked and verified so Insurance Policies are in place in case they are needed, and all of that achieved with less human intervention, all handled throughout the security of blockchain.

"We haven’t gone out and said we’re the Amazon of the sharing economy, but it’s an apt description of what we’re doing. We want there to be one ecosystem to operate in for everything from payment processing to ID checks,” ShareRing co-founder Tim Bos told StartupSmart in March.
